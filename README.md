99 Scala problems lab project
=========================

Forked from Amir Moulavi who also used this project to learn Scala.

Intended for educational purpose.

Based on the original 99 Scala problems http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/

Content of the 99 problems
------------------------

A common implementation is Recursion i combination with the match case statement.

Where lists should shrink (e.g. compress) then consider foldRight




Ideas on how to make a lab
------------------------

Meta idea: The purpose of this project is for me to learn Scala. A positive side effect would be to provide a lab that
could help even more people to learn Scala.

Baseline for all ideas: Make it test driven. Define the tests and allow student
to implement code so that tests go green.

All the implementations could have "dummy shells" so that they compile but tests fail.

So how to allow students to verify their attempts or how to assist when stuck?

a) have a working implementation done but commented a few lines down on each implementation class. The student would see
the working code unless deliberately scrolling down a page or two.

b) have a working implementation done in a git branch

c) refer to teh internet where the original S99 project with working code or other variants out there
